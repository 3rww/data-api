# Development

## Quickstart

Follow the steps in `setup_development.md` to get your environments set up and dependencies installed.

In one terminal, at the root directory of the project, enter `pipenv run python manage.py runserver`. This starts up a Django web server, which serves up the application's ReST API. When that is running, you'll be able to hit [localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api) for the main API documentation endpoint.
